##Short summary
I was working in social media marketing for 4.5 years. I used to be a targetologist and engaged in setting up and launching advertising on Facebook, Instagram, VK, TikTok.

As time passes, my goals and priorities have changed. So I decided to realize myself in the way which I considered earlier and which is more suitable for me now. I suppose self-discipline, strong desire to learn and RS School community should help me to become a good front-end developer.
